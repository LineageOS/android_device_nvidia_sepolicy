I\u0027m assuming the kernel should always have read access to those files, so having labels for every new added firmware seems like a maintenance overhead. Let me know if I should revert and create a new label specific to the intel firmware.\n\nAlso enabled access to lspci for lkm_loader and gave access to net_bind_service to rfcomm.ko (which will be built after https://review.lineageos.org/q/I33d72d46acaa9b493a623dcb76bf8cadbe135471)",
